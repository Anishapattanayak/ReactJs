useContext:-

In React, data flows parent → child using props.

That’s fine until this happens:

App
→ Component A
→ Component B
→ Component C

If Component C needs data from App, you end up passing props through A and B even though they don’t need it.

This is called prop drilling.
It makes code messy and hard to maintain.

👉 useContext exists to avoid prop drilling.

What is useContext (in simple words):-

useContext is a React hook that lets any component directly access shared data, without passing props step by step.








1️⃣ Create a Context
import { createContext } from "react";

const UserContext = createContext();
export default UserContext;
This creates a container to store data.


2️⃣ Provide the Context (share the data)
Usually done in App.js or a parent component.
import UserContext from "./UserContext";
import Profile from "./Profile";
function App() {
  const user = "Anisha";
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Profile />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}
export default App;
📌 value={user} is the data you want to share.



3️⃣ Consume the Context using useContext
Now any child component can directly access it.
import { useContext } from "react";
import UserContext from "./UserContext";

function Profile() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);

  return <h1>Hello, {user}</h1>;
}
export default Profile;


✅ No props
✅ Clean code
✅ Easy to manage


How useContext works internally (easy view)
React checks the nearest Provider
Takes the value
Gives it to the component calling useContext
When should you use useContext?


Use it when:
Same data is needed in many components
Data is global or semi-global
Examples:

User login info
Theme (dark/light mode)
Language
Cart data in e-commerce
Authentication status
When NOT to use useContext


Avoid it when:
Data is used by only 1–2 components
Data changes very frequently (can cause re-renders)
In those cases, normal props or state is better.
